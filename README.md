This Webpage is intended as lab assignment for class CS-483 Fall-2018 by Prabesh, Emad and Austin. 

There is a navigation bar at the top of the page. This navigation bar will be used in the future to navigate to other pages of the website. There is a form to sign up for newsletters with your email. It will be fully implemented in future versions of the site.

The first index page is for selected book. It shows the TITLE, IMAGE, ISBN, SUMMARY, TAGS, and REVIEW of the selected book. In future versions of the website, users will be able to search for books by the previously mentioned items. This page will serve as a base page for each selected book. 

Index.html page is the main HTML page for the website. Index.css is an external css page for Index.html.

8/31/2018 - Started adding bootstrap to the website. Used a jumbotron for homepage to draw attention. Old HTML and CSS is still in the files.

TODO - Find background video, finish site header, add section under jumbotron for explanation of website (divided into grid columns). Use fontawesome library for icons.
